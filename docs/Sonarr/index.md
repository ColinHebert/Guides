Here you will find a collection of Sonarr guides I made.

## Master

(Default/Stable): This has been tested by users on nightly (`develop`) branch and it's not known to have any major issues. This branch should be used by the majority of users.

On GitHub, this is the `main` branch.

## Develop

![Develop](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?query=%24.version&url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hotio/sonarr/nightly/VERSION.json&label=Current%20Develop/Nightly%20Version&style=for-the-badge&color=4051B5){ .off-glb }

(Alpha/Unstable) : This is the bleeding edge. It is released as soon as code is committed and passes all automated tests. This build may have not been used by us or other users yet. There is no guarantee that it will even run in some cases. This branch is only recommended for advanced users. Issues and self investigation are expected in this branch.

!!! Warning

    **You may not be able to go back to `main` after switching to this branch.**

On GitHub, this is the `develop` branch.
